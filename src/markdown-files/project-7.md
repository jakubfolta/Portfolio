A website created for the Polish private nursery in the "hybrid" app model. Django is being used to serve the React application and provide frontend data through the REST framework. Data are saved in Heroku's PostgreSQL database. Gallery images are fetched from AWS S3.
Thanks to Django, the user can easily change almost every aspect of the website through the admin panel.
