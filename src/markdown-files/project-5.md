Project which I started after finishing React course and at the same time website which you're watching now ;). My own portfolio which I couldn't wait to finish and I'm very proud of. I've used Gatsby, static site generator, to make my portfolio really fast. Data are read from markdown files so next projects could be add in seconds.
