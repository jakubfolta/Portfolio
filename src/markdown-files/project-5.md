A project which I started after finishing React course and at the same time website which you're watching now ;). My own portfolio which I couldn't wait to finish and I'm very proud of. I've used Gatsby, a static site generator, to make my portfolio really fast. Data are read from markdown files so the next projects could be added in seconds.
