Very useful app if you are tired of receiving missed gifts. Create a list of items you want to get and then share a link with the world. Simple as that ;). Basic functionality is done but I have an idea of other features to implement like: pagination, create collections of items, other color themes, reset the password, google login, add images to our items.
